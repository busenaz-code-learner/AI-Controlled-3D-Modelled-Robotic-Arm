## AI-Controlled-3D-Modelled-Robotic-Arm
**Brief Information:**

This is a robotic arm which basically mimics your hand movement by detecting your computer camera.

In this project, I used KL25z Board to controlled my servos and OpenCv to detect my hand movements.
Also for communication between the phyton and the C language, I used Arduino as a tool.

Note : The embedded C is written on Keil uVision5 environment.

## About the Project

‚ö°Ô∏è In this project I use computer vision to track hand and replicate that on the arm. The 21 landmarks of the hand is detected by using openCV in Python Language. Then the angles between joints detected and by that data the servos are turned. 

‚ö°Ô∏è The communication is provided by using UART module between Arduino and the development board from COM 8. 

‚ö°Ô∏è The arm is printed by 3D printer and servo motors are controlled by using embedded C Language on Keil environment. The C program is loaded to the KL25z board.
## You can find 3D Prints

I use the website InMoov which is 100% free, you can download the models and printed them.
